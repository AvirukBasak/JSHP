- Write good code, well commented, well structured, well readable.
- If you find my code illegible immediately open an issue with the code file and lines reported.
- Test your code manually, heavily, coz I've got no experience with auto-testing (you could help me out here).

# Find a bug
Yes it's a bug bounty, and you don't need to write any code, only test the framework.

In return, you create a PR and an Issue with the info on buggy code and you get a contribution count in `HacktoberFest 2023`.
That's its sole purpose.
